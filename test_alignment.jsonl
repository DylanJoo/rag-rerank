Asked how long the talks had been going on, Gates said, \"A few weeks maybe.\" Word of negotiations with the Taliban came first from Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Saturday. However, Gates emphasized that an immediate end to the fighting was not likely.", "Gates is stepping down from as Defense secretary in less than two weeks, and he expressed his thoughts on the ongoing negotiations. \"My own thoughts are that real reconciliation talks are not likely to be able to make any substantive headway until at least this winter,\" he said. \"I think the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure and begin to believe that they can't win before they are willing to have a serious conversation.\""], ["Outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert Gates defended the Obama administration Sunday against congressional critics who say President Barack Obama is in violation of the War Powers Act over ongoing operations in Libya. Gates stated that he believes President Obama has complied with the law, just like his predecessors, and that he is not breaking any new ground in this instance. He made these comments on \"Fox News Sunday\" in response to criticism from Congress.", "The War Powers Act generally requires the president to seek congressional approval within 60 days of the start of hostilities. However, the Obama administration has maintained that their mission in Libya is too limited to apply under the War Powers Act. Gates clarified the Pentagon's stance, stating that they view their involvement in Libya as a \"limited kinetic operation.\" This distinction is crucial, as it determines whether the operation falls under the purview of the War Powers Act.", "Gates' comments come as the Obama administration continues to face criticism from Congress over its handling of the situation in Libya. Critics argue that the administration has failed to obtain congressional approval for the ongoing operations, which they claim is a violation of the War Powers Act. In response, Gates emphasized that the administration's actions are consistent with the actions of previous presidents, and that they are not attempting to circumvent the law. He also noted that if the situation were to escalate and become more intense, the administration would likely be viewed as being at war."], ["David Axelrod, a senior strategist to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign, has responded to Jon Huntsman's recent criticism of the administration's economic policy. Axelrod stated in an interview that Huntsman never voiced any disagreements with Obama's economic policy during his time as U.S. ambassador to China in 2009. Axelrod recalled a meeting with Huntsman in Shanghai, where he said Huntsman had ample opportunity to share his views on the economy but chose not to.", "Axelrod suggested that Huntsman's criticism of Obama's \"failed\" economic policy is a result of his shift in perspective, rather than a genuine change in his views. He implied that Huntsman's newfound criticism is driven by his desire to win the Republican presidential nomination, which he perceives as an opportunity. Axelrod acknowledged that this is a common aspect of politics, but expressed his understanding of Huntsman's perspective. He also recalled Huntsman's positive comments on Obama's policies during their 2009 meeting, including his support for healthcare reform.", "Axelrod's comments on Huntsman's shift in perspective were made in an interview aired on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. He expressed his belief that Huntsman's previous praise for Obama's policies is at odds with his current criticism. Axelrod stated that Huntsman's quizzical nature about his own party's stance on issues during their 2009 meeting suggested that he was waiting for a more opportune time to enter the political arena, which Axelrod believes may be 2016. Axelrod's response underscores the increasingly tense relationship between the Obama administration and Republican presidential candidates."]], "questions": ["Who is confirmed to be engaged in \"preliminary\" talks with the Taliban?", "At what level is the State Department handling these talks?", "What does Robert Gates believe is a necessary condition for the Taliban to have a \"serious conversation\"?", "According to Gates, at what time should the Taliban \"feel themselves under military pressure\"?", "Which US agency is currently involved in \"limited kinetic operation\"?", "What would some GOP candidates have to face if they try to get to Obama's left?", "According to Lindsey Graham, how should the president have communicated the involvement in Libya?", "What is Lindsey Graham willing to be a part of regarding Libya?", "Who has a differing view of their chances to win the nomination, but has the same view of the economy?", "What has changed in Jon Huntsman's view, as stated by David Axelrod?"], "ratings": [[5, 5, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 4, 1, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4]]}

A Gallup Poll, taken after the president's nationally televised address on Afghanistan, shows that those who support his plan include a significant number who would like to see a faster withdrawal than he has proposed. Twenty-three percent of those polled oppose the president's plan. The public's growing support for the withdrawal of troops is attributed to the elimination of Osama bin Laden and the steady drumbeat of bad news from Afghanistan, according to Richard Eichenberg, a political scientist at Tufts University in Massachusetts.", "The support for Obama's plan is evident across party lines, with Democrats favoring it by nearly 9-1. However, there are warning signs for the president in his own party, according to John Mueller of Ohio State University, who studies public opinion toward wars. Among Democrats, 30% say Obama should withdraw more troops, and 40% say they should be pulled out sooner. This could potentially lead to a lack of enthusiasm among anti-war Democrats, which could impact the president's re-election prospects, Mueller warns. The poll also found that 31% of Americans oppose the idea of setting any timetable to withdraw U.S. troops, including 54% of Republicans.", "Under Obama's plan, about 10,000 troops would be withdrawn by December, and the rest of the so-called surge troops, about 23,000, would be pulled out by next September. All U.S. forces would come home by 2014. The poll, taken Saturday and Sunday of 1,034 adults, has a margin of error of +/-4 percentage points. The Republican presidential field is divided on the issue, with former Utah governor Jon Huntsman calling for significantly fewer troops on the ground, and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney saying it's \"time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can.\" Addressing the Council on Foreign Relations, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty pushed back, faulting Obama's response to the pro-democracy movement in the Arab world and embracing a muscular foreign policy."], ["Americans broadly support President Barack Obama's plan to withdraw U.S. forces in Afghanistan, with 72% in favor and 23% opposed, according to a June 25-26 Gallup poll. The majority of Democrats, independents, and half of Republicans favor the plan's outlines. However, Americans are more divided on the specific goal of having 30,000 U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 15 months, with 43% considering this number about right, 29% too low, and 19% too high.", "The reaction to Obama's timetable for withdrawing troops is also mixed, with less than a third (30%) fully endorsing it. Democrats are the most supportive, but even among them, fewer than half (45%) agree with the timetable. The slight majority of Republicans (54%) say no timetable should be set, while independents are evenly divided between agreeing with Obama's timetable and wanting an accelerated one. The Gallup poll suggests that Obama's plan may not have fully satisfied Democrats' and independents' desire for a swift withdrawal.", "The mixed support for Obama's plan may partly explain his lagging job approval rating, as well as the lack of a significant boost to his rating after his June 22 speech announcing his \"way forward in Afghanistan.\" The public's reaction to the plan reflects their views on the pace of troop withdrawal and the impact of announcing a timetable on the U.S. war effort.
