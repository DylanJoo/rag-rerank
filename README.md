# Inference Retrieval-augmengated Generation
---

### Pipeline
This repo modularizes the following phase into standalone modules.

- [Indexing]()
- [Retrieval]()
- [Augment]()
- [Generate]()
- [Verify](): under construction.

The [Wrapper]() would integrate all the modules and take the query as input for generate RAG results.
