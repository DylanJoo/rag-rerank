Seasoned raw and 'undercooked' meats are eaten  the world around with varying amounts of illness caused, largely dependent on the quality of local food safety regulation and sanitation tradition.\n\nIf you are still a stickler, there are products which are sanitized with ionizing radiation which allow one to eat raw food (such as eggs) with even lower risk of infection, although some have estimated that the risk to factory workers is higher than the illness avoided by such practices.",

The dish originated from the Tartars associated with the Mongol invaders in medieval times.\nDocument [9]: (Title: Beef/Steak Tartare: Sigmund Freud's Breakfast, and Favorite Dish of Claude Lanzmann and Thomas Bernhard #cannibals #freudianbrunch | SCHIBBOLETH) when it was already accepted to prepare it with beef.

            "output": " [1] highlights that quality beef and proper refrigeration can make steak tartare a safe option. The key difference between undercooked beef and steak tartare is the handling and preparation of the beef. When steak tartare is prepared, the beef is mixed with ingredients and refrigerated until serving, which minimizes the risk of contamination [1]. On the other hand, undercooked beef is typically cooked to a lower temperature, which can still harbor harmful bacteria. As [3] and [4] show, undercooked beef has been linked to food-borne outbreaks. Meanwhile, [7] advises against eating raw ground beef due to the risk of organisms being present. However, the combination of quality beef and proper refrigeration in steak tartare preparation makes it a safer option [1]. Therefore, steak tartare can be served when undercooked beef is not due to the careful handling and refrigeration of the beef, reducing the risk of contamination and food-borne illnesses."

Every few seconds, you check a meter to see how fast water is coming out of the tap. Then you can add up these measurements to figure out pretty closely how much is left in the tank!\n\nTechnically speaking, the device measures current consumption rapidly and performs integration to give a figure of amp-hours or watt-hours consumed.",

            "output": " Devices such as phones, iPods, laptops, and other electronic devices use various methods to determine the exact percentage of battery remaining. According to Document [5], the Apple iPod Touch 3rd generation has a \"Battery Percentage\" option that allows for precise measurement of remaining battery power. In addition, manufacturers often include sophisticated battery management systems that monitor the battery's charge level and calculate the remaining battery life [1, 3, 4, 8]. These systems may use various algorithms to estimate the remaining capacity based on factors such as the device's usage patterns, battery health, and environmental conditions [2, 9]. It is important to note that different devices may use different methods to determine battery percentage, and users can take steps to maintain their battery life by following proper charging and usage habits, such as avoiding extreme temperatures and keeping the device's firmware up to date [6, 7, 10].

            "output": " Gypsies are a traditionally nomadic ethnic group with a shared history and culture, [1] who are often stigmatized and perceived in a negative light. The term \"Gypsy\" can be offensive to some members of the Romani community, [2] who prefer to be referred to as Romnichel or Roma. The negative connotations surrounding the term \"Gypsy\" may be attributed to the widespread media portrayal of Gypsies as untrustworthy, dishonest, and criminal, [7] which perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination. However, it is essential to recognize that not all Gypsies fit these stereotypes, and many are victims of prejudice and marginalization. [3] The complex and multifaceted nature of Gypsy identity is often reduced to simplistic and offensive stereotypes, which reinforces the negative perception of Gypsies and further marginalizes them. [4] Furthermore, some people use the term \"Gypsy\" as a derogatory slur, which contributes to the negative connotations associated with the term. [5] In addition, the case of Gypsy Rose, a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is an example of how Gypsies are often perceived as outsiders and are subject to negative stereotypes and stigma. [9] Therefore, it is crucial to approach the term \"Gypsy\" with sensitivity and respect, recognizing the complexity and diversity of Gypsy identity and experiences. [8]"

A handgun is more portable, and easier to maneuver in tight quarters. A shotgun has a wide spread, for more damage in close quarters and less need to aim. An SMG was originally designed to quickly clear enemy trenches: it's essentially a machine gun that shoots handgun rounds. A machine gun is designed to do the same things as a rifle, just with more rounds, and thus a better chance of a kill. It's also good for suppressive fire.",

According to [1], TV remotes that use Bluetooth technology can work in any direction, as they rely on radio frequencies that can pass through walls and objects. In contrast, infrared (IR) technology requires direct line-of-sight between the remote and the TV, as it uses infrared light to transmit commands.

(Of course that doesn't mean that the other end that plugs into the wall will have to also have these features).\n\nThe plugs are compatible with the inlets of the unearthed version of the standard (C17/C18) and the inlets are compatible with the plugs of the higher temperature versions of the standard (C15(a)/C16(a)).\n\nThey are rated for up to 10 ampere and incompatible with the plugs and inlets of the standards for more or less Ampere.\n\nAll that is designed to keep people from accidentally frying their equipment, themselves or burning their house down to easily.",

The detachable cord set consists of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, and the three-pronged connector ensures a safe connection by providing a return path for excess electrical current, as mentioned in document [5]. On the other hand, most appliances have fixed cords because they do not require the convenience of detachability. The strange three-pronged connector on computer power cords is a safety feature designed to prevent damage to the appliance or shock to the user, as mentioned in document [5]. This is in contrast to smaller, light-duty cords that may only use two prongs and are ungrounded, as mentioned in document [5]. Finally, computers have detachable power cords with three-pronged connectors because it allows for safe and easy replacement of the cord if it becomes damaged, as mentioned in document [9]. [1] [5]"

            "answer": "It's interesting when you look at dust in the full scale that it really is: dust is everywhere. Literally. The bits that ultimately make up dust are so tiny, it's like salt in the ocean; you're breathing it in right now as you read this. Don't worry though, it's harmless (in normal conditions) and a main factor is dead skin anyway, so it's as bad as chewing your nails, if that at all.\n\nI say that last part for a point. The \"origin\" of dust is everywhere, but the consistently noticeable contributor is dead skin. And you're doing it right now. Right this second, hundreds of tiny tiny bits are floating off your arms and legs like daffodils. Don't believe me? Go in a room with some harsh light contrast (for us photographers, that's fancy talk for a room with a source of really strong light, like a window, but otherwise pretty unlit) and rub your arms a few times, watch the tiny little flakes float off. Your hair is even worse, regardless of dandruff, because it can get caught in the hairs, so if you ruffle your hair, boom, a mini-snowstorm.\n\nSo now we know where it comes from (everything) and where it's found (everywhere) but why don't we see it all over the place? And why do we see it layered on top of undisturbed things like an abandoned home or that space on the top of your TV? Well, both questions are answered by one word: wind. The dust is so tiny, it takes a lot of dust (and in dust terms, we're talking thousands of particles) to weigh it down to one place. The slightest breeze prevents this, so busy, open places with wind or high traffic are naturally void of any build up. Alternatively, when dust is given the time, those particles rub against each other, develop static cling, and clump. This is also why you see cobwebs that are so thick they sometimes drop to the floor.\n\n**TL;DR Dust is dust because we are slowly dying and do nothing to stop it.**",

This is likely the reason why you feel the urge to pee while in the water. According to [8], drinking water makes you pee frequently because the body tries to eliminate excess water by producing more urine. When you drink water, it increases the amount of liquid in your body, which can lead to increased urine production and, therefore, the need to pee. [9] also supports this idea, stating that drinking a large amount of water can increase the frequency of urination.

            "answer": "The Austrian School of economic thought basically says that the decisions of individuals matter more than that of a group of people together. Obviously a group of people has more pull than any one person, but this school more scrutinizes what each individual person in the group does, whereas most other schools of economics don't care about that they only want to know what the end result of the activities of the group in question.\n\nFor example: 5 friends go to a bar, 4 of them buy one drink, and one of them gets bombed and gets 11 drinks. On average they got 3 each, so most economists would care about that, however the austrian school really wants to know why that one guy got bombed and the others didn't. \n\n_URL_0_\n\nThe Chicago School focuses on rejecting keynesianism in favor of neo-classicalism. \n\nWhat are these two theories? Keynesianism is the theory that the government should intervene in the market in order to achieve the best possible result. For example: Keynesians are usually in favor of \"smoothing out the business cycle\". When times are good, they raise taxes and cut government spending, to achieve a government surplus and not allow the economy to get too out of hand. When the economy is bad, they lower taxes and boost spending, running deficits in order to boost economic activity and get things going again. Their main goal is to have a steady amount of small growth, rarely having big booms or recessions/depressions.\n\nNeoclassicalism on the other hand is the opposite. It aims to have as little government intervention in the economy as possible and believes this contributes to the best economic picture. In this type of system the government attempts to keep itself neutral at all times, rarely running surpluses or deficits. It allows bubbles to form and burst as they will, leading to large fluctuations in the state of the economy. Sometimes things are awesome and sometimes they suck. However they believe that over time the awesomeness more than cancels out the suck (to put it basically). \n\n_URL_1_\n\nI can't really explain why academia doesn't accept the austrian school, but at first glance it seems a little suspect. I am no economist however I did take a few economics classes back in the day, and I definitely think the Chicago school makes more sense, or even keynesianism (which I am not a big fan of).",

            "output": " The Austrian School of Economic thought is an economic school of thought that emphasizes methodological individualism, subjective value theory, and the importance of human action in shaping economic outcomes. [1] It is characterized by its rejection of the neoclassical approach and its emphasis on the role of individual decision-making in the economy. [2] The school's core principles, such as the concept of marginal utility and the idea that the market is a reflection of human action, remain the same despite incorporating knowledge from outside sources. [10]  The Austrian School of Economics has nothing to do with the economic policy of Austria, and its name is largely a historical coincidence. [5]  Additionally, the school's ideas may be compatible with behavioral psychology and neuroscience, but its utility as an economic framework is debated. [6] According to some experts, the Austrian School has become increasingly popular among students in recent years due to its unique perspective on economics. [8] Overall, the Austrian School of Economics is a school of thought that offers a distinct and nuanced perspective on the workings of the economy. [7] [9] [10]  The most commonly cited authors of the Austrian School are Carl Menger, Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. The school's philosophy is based on human action and the concept of marginal utility, which differs from the neoclassical approach.

            "question_ctx": "..took a 30min nap yesterday. Had a dream. Lived about a week in my dream. How is this possible?",
            "answer": "tl;dr: your brain is basically an xbox and life is a video game you're trying really hard not to lose your last life in. when you have a week long dream in a single night, it's basically like playing non-stop through a week of in-game time over the course of like 40 out-of-game minutes.\n\n--\n\nboring rambling:\n\nSo your brain isn't actually very good at rendering the real world. Instead what you get is a really really really good near-real-time updated 3d simulation of a convenient-to-navigate model of the universe.\n\nThink of it this way. Most of the matter around you is made up of completely empty space. A rock you press against isn't actually solid, but your brain represents it as such to you, because at the scale which you exist, that representation is a lot more useful than what's actually there.\n\nWhich, for reference, is basically little bits of nothing deflecting other little bits of nothing with big powerful fields that extend far beyond the meager size of the actual atomic components.\n\nMore so, time itself doesn't actually \"flow\" so much as it exists as a convenient metric by which we can measure change in our own existence. In reality, time is inherently locked together with space into what is called (and you've likely heard of) spacetime. One of the consequences of this is that you shouldn't think of time as some kind of a line that a 3d cube (representing the universe) is moving along. Rather, the reason photons never \"age\" is because they're moving at the speed of light. Anything moving that fast experiences \"0 time\", as it were.\n\nAll this to say: your brain is basically a super-duper powered xbox capable of an incomprehensible number of computations. [1 second of simulated brain activity took almost 85,000 processors](_URL_0_). It takes in a ridiculous number of inputs from the outside world and uses these to create a coherent model of your surroundings, which is really very beneficial to your continued survival. But, it also means you can dismiss the notion that your brain is just a thing inside your head and that you're living in the same \"world\" that you perceive.\n\nA dream which \"takes you through a week\" isn't actually moving you through a week. It's unclear exactly what's happening, and I'm not a cognitive scientist or expert on the actual neruomechanical goings-on so I'll abstain from saying anything about that.",

Wondering why a dream feels so long is similar to the previous question of whether a dream can feel like years. It depends what someone means by saying it lasted a long time. If they mean the dream felt longer than other dreams, that's certainly possible. Most dreams are 5-20 minutes long.

This is because the dreams are so vivid that it seems like we've been asleep for much longer than we have been. [6] This is also supported by Document [8], which states that the REM sleep stage, where dreams occur, becomes longer as the night goes on. Additionally, Document [9] suggests that the length of a dream can also depend on the individual's perception and memory. [9] Finally, Document [10] states that while most dreams only last a few minutes, they can feel longer, and there is no consensus on the role of dreams in mental health and cognitive wellness. [10] Overall, it seems that the length of a dream can be influenced by various factors, including the duration of the REM sleep stage, individual perception, and memory, which can contribute to the feeling that a dream went on for much longer than it actually did.

            "output": "\u00a0The process professional animators use when making movies involves several steps, including modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation. According to [1] and [2], professional animators use various software such as Maya, Cinema4D, Blender, and SketchUp to create three-dimensional models and animations. They also work together as a team to ensure that the final product meets the producer's vision [3]. However, the exact process of making an animated movie is complex and involves many stages, from pre-production to post-production, and requires specialized skills and software. For instance, [10] highlights the role of an editor in assembling the final product, while [9] discusses the importance of a professional voice over in capturing the audience's attention. Furthermore, [8] explains that animation is a way of making a movie from many still images, and [4] and [5] provide an insight into the passion and creativity that animators bring to their work.

            "answer": "No, it would have enough kinetic energy to leave the material, but as it traveled farther and farther away, it would slow down, eventually reaching zero kinetic energy at an infinite distance.\n\nHere's an analogy; the Earth is a material, and a rocket is an electron. The rocket is accelerated to escape velocity, and it leaves the Earth at great speed, but since the Earth's gravitational field extends infinitely, the rocket would always be slowly accelerating towards the Earth. So the rocket would get slower and slower, and as its distance from Earth reached infinity, its speed would reach zero.\n\nJust like the electron getting knocked out of a material, it initially has a nonzero speed, but slows down to zero speed at an infinite distance away.\n\nEdit: There's also a few other differences between gravitational fields and the fields that influence electrons; force due to gravity is inversely proportional to distance^2, but the forces between an electron and an atom are not as simple. The force when an electron is near an atom is incredibly strong, but the force even a few more nano-meters away almost fully disappears, so an electron that is ejected with JUST the right amount of energy will have practically no (but still nonzero) kinetic energy as it moves away from the material it was ejected from.",

            "output": " The obstacles that prevent a truly comparable synthetic alternative to feathers/down in pillows and comforters are multifaceted. While synthetic down alternatives are available, they may not provide the same level of comfort and durability as natural down [2, 4, 6]. Furthermore, the unique properties of natural down, such as its ability to maintain its shape and provide insulation, are difficult to replicate with synthetic materials [4, 5]. Additionally, the sensory experience of using a down pillow or comforter, such as the feel of the down and the sound of it rustling, may not be fully replicable with synthetic alternatives [1, 7]. Therefore, it can be challenging to develop a truly comparable synthetic alternative to feathers/down in pillows and comforters. [2, 3, 9]"

            "question_ctx": "",
            "answer": "Splitting /an/ atom doesn't. The explosion comes because each atom splits more than one atom with its products. The energy actually comes from breaking the internal bonds of the larger atoms to give two smaller atoms. If you can control this process, you can generate a predictable amount of heat and use it as a nuclear reactor. If the process is a runaway reaction (each step makes the next step more effective) you get an explosion. If the amount of new products relative to old is poor, you get something like NK nukes, where some of it goes boom, but most of it just heats up to gas or gets blown apart by the first. If the amount relative is good, you get the sort of nuke you see in declassified US DOD videos where a large percentage undergoes fission.",

            "output": " We are so afraid to look each other in the eye because we fear what others might think of us, or that we might be judged, ridiculed, or rejected [1]. This fear stems from the need for validation and acceptance from others, which is a fundamental human desire [2]. Additionally, our fear of being vulnerable and authentic can also prevent us from making eye contact [3]. It is natural for humans to look at each other's eyes, as it is a sign of trust, intimacy, and connection [4]. However, when we are afraid or uncomfortable, we often avoid eye contact, which can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation [5, 6]. The fear of intimacy, which is the fear of being close or vulnerable to another person, can also prevent us from making eye contact [7]. Ultimately, our fear of looking each other in the eye is rooted in our fear of being ourselves and being vulnerable to others."

The street credential is in putting the damaging tag in a visible location that remains up for an extended length of time. A quick search of Google news shows reports about taggers who fell to their death or fell to extreme injury while trying to tag in dangerous places without appropriate safety gear. Many of them are taking risks, perhaps freecliming or occasionally using a simple climbing harness, to put their vandalism on the wall.\n\nWe had some high rise buildings tagged quite high a few years back.

            "output": " Really elaborate graffiti winds up on extremely hard to reach places such as freeway signs or walls through a combination of creativity, skill, and risk-taking. As documented in [1], graffiti artists often create elaborate works on hard-to-reach places, which is respected in the graffiti and crew culture. According to [10], graffiti on overhanging freeway signs can be accessed only by climbing through dense vegetation or climbing, making it an \"extreme sport\" for vandals. This requires a high level of skill and physical ability, as seen in [2] where Chester's dad is teaching him how to use a spray can, which is surprisingly difficult. The more elaborate the graffiti, the more highly skilled the graffiti writer, as stated in [4]. Furthermore, the need for creativity and skill in creating elaborate graffiti is evident in [8] where the author questions the meaning of a striking piece of graffiti in an area undergoing rapid development. [3] and [5] also highlight the importance of skill and creativity in graffiti writing, with the first document discussing the frequency of graffiti \"beefs\" within the community and the second document explaining the differences between graffiti and tagging. [6] and [7] provide further insights into the importance of inspiration and perseverance in the graffiti community. Overall, really elaborate graffiti winds up on extremely hard to reach places because of the combination of creativity, skill, and risk-taking that graffiti artists use to create their works.

For many women, super duper absorbent tampons are not going to be comfortable to wear if your flow isn't heavy enough for them. Any company that would switch to only producing super heavy flow tampons would see their sales figures crash enormously.\n\nAdditionally, it is not healthy to just leave a tampon in there longer. It is not as common anymore, but wearing tampons, especially super absorbent ones is a risk factor for [Toxic Shock Syndrome] (_URL_0_). The best way to cut the risk is to frequently change your tampon.\n\nedit: to add, removing a tampon that is mostly dry (which is what many women would constantly have to do if they'd wear super absorbent tampons when their flow is not heavy enough), is at best really uncomfortable, at worst actually a bit painful.",

Don\u2019t ever flush a tampon; they can clog septic systems and are not biodegradable. Why it\u2019s important to change your tampon often Changing your tampon frequently can help prevent toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is thought to be caused by the growth of streptococcus that can sometimes develop when tampons are left in too long. Remember to change your tampon multiple times a day. If you\u2019re leaking a bit, consider moving up to a higher-absorbency tampon for a few days to help manage the flow.

            "output": " Tampon companies make tampons with multiple levels of absorbency to cater to the varying flow levels of menstruation, as stated by [7] and [1]. This allows users to choose the appropriate absorbency level to prevent leaks and manage their menstrual flow effectively. Additionally, tampons with higher absorbency levels increase the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome, as explained in [4] and [8], which highlights the importance of choosing the lowest absorbency necessary. Furthermore, tampon companies provide different absorbency levels to accommodate different flow levels, as mentioned in [5] and [9]. Overall, the multiple levels of absorbency in tampons enable users to manage their menstrual flow and reduce the risk of complications, as detailed in [3] and [10].

[1], [2], [5], [6] The recoil force causes the muzzle to lift up, which is because the recoil action is not directed at the center of gravity of the gun but above it. [5] Martin's clothing was hanging downward from his body by the force of gravity when the gun was fired. [6] There is no evidence to suggest a gun wants to go up against gravity. Guns do not have a desire or intention to do anything. It is purely a mechanical device. [1], [2] It follows gravity as any other object on earth does. [10] The concept of a gun wanting to go up against gravity is not accurate. [5] Therefore, the question is based on a misconception. 2. The reason for the muzzle lift up is due to recoil action [5] In contrast to other questions that may relate to a gun, such as gun safety storage, gun laws, or gun rights, the reason a gun goes up against gravity when fired is simply due to the recoil action. [5] Therefore, the question is purely focused on the mechanical properties of a gun and does not involve any external factors. [6] When a gun is fired, the recoil force causes the muzzle to lift up because the recoil action is not directed at the center of gravity of the gun but above it.

These rhythms are regulated by the body's natural cycles and are influenced by external factors such as environment and lifestyle [3]. For example, the circadian rhythm is influenced by the sleep-wake cycle, while the heart rhythm is influenced by factors such as stress and exercise [9]. These rhythms are essential for maintaining overall health and well-being, and disruptions can lead to a range of health problems [3]. In the case of the internet, Adler suggests that its lack of schedule does not mean it lacks rhythm, but rather, its rhythm is driven by our desires and behaviors [1]. Similarly, calendars, whether traditional or modern, are designed to help us keep track of our daily and seasonal rhythms, which are important for our well-being and productivity [7]. Overall, rhythm is a vital aspect of our daily lives, and understanding its causes and purposes can help us better appreciate its importance in maintaining our overall health and well-being.

            "output": " Muscles tend to get less sore after a workout when you work out on a regular basis because the minute muscle damage and tearing, as well as damage of the surrounding tissues, which cause soreness, can be adapted to over time [10]. According to [2], the phrase \"no pain, no gain\" is a myth, and continual workouts may lead to less soreness and muscle growth. Additionally, the body may adapt to the intense workout by changing the metabolic process, resulting in less muscle soreness [10]. [1] also suggests that if a person is not used to working out regularly, muscles can become sore and need time to heal. This implies that regular workouts can lead to less soreness over time. Overall, the combination of adaptation to muscle damage, changes in metabolic process, and the myth of \"no pain, no gain\" can contribute to muscles getting less sore after regular workouts.
