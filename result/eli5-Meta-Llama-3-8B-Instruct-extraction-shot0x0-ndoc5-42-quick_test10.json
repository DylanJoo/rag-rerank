            "output": " When we get hit in the head, we go unconscious due to a complex interplay of physiological and neurological mechanisms. When the head is injured, it can cause a sudden and significant increase in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain and a reduction in oxygen delivery [6]. This decrease in oxygen supply can cause the brain to become hypoxic, leading to a loss of consciousness [7]. Additionally, the injury can also cause a release of chemical mediators such as histamine and bradykinin, which can further contribute to the decrease in blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain [8]. As a result, the individual may become unconscious, which is a temporary state characterized by a loss of awareness of one's surroundings and the ability to respond to stimuli [9]."

If the process is a runaway reaction (each step makes the next step more effective) you get an explosion. If the amount of new products relative to old is poor, you get something like NK nukes, where some of it goes boom, but most of it just heats up to gas or gets blown apart by the first.

            "question_ctx": "The U.S. and other countries have been capable of producing nuclear weapons for decades, but other countries like North Korea and Iran seem to engage in lots of tests and experiments to develop weapons.  Why is that?  \n\nIs the technology used by other nuclear-nations not capable of being replicated by others?",
            "answer": "They're just inherently hard to build. *How* hard depends on what we're talking about, but even the simplest nuclear bomb isn't something you could cook up in your basement.\n\nTo start with, you need *fissile material.* That's either highly refined uranium, or even more highly refined plutonium. Refining uranium to the point where it's useful in a bomb is *incredibly* hard, in no small part because uranium hexafluoride \u2014\u00a0the chemical compound you actually have to do the refining to \u2014\u00a0is one of the most corrosive things around. Refining plutonium is even harder, because it requires a *nuclear reactor* to do it.\n\nThen, once you've got the fissile material, you have to build a bomb around it. You can't just duct tape it to a stick of dynamite or a block of semtex; you have to build a *very special kind* of bomb to *very tight* engineering tolerances. Get that wrong and the bomb will still go off, but you won't get a nuclear explosion. You'll get a regular old explosion that sprays toxic fissile material around. (Which may be all you're after if you're a crazy person looking to make trouble, but to anybody who's not in that category, that's an unqualified failure.)\n\nThen there's the question of how you deliver the bomb you've built \u2026\u00a0assuming you got that far. See, it's *relatively* easy to build a huge, heavy atomic bomb. (\"Relatively easy\" here meaning \"still incredibly hard, just not as hard as the other stuff we're about to talk about.\") But huge, heavy atomic bombs are, well, *huge* and *heavy!* They can only be delivered by planes, and *gigantic and slow* planes at that. That worked out okay a couple times in the 40s, but that's at play you really only get to run once, because it's trivially easy to defend against if the other guy's even remotely paying attention.\n\nSo instead, the idea is to stick your atomic bomb on top of a rocket. Unlike gigantic, slow planes, rockets are *really* hard to defend against \u2026 but you can't stick a huge, heavy bomb on top of a rocket. To use a rocket to deliver your bomb, you need your bomb to be very small and lightweight. Think large-dog sized, rather than herd-of-elephants sized.\n\nAnd building an atomic bomb that's small and lightweight is *much* harder than building a big, heavy one. Remember when I said the engineering tolerances for a nuclear bomb are very strict? The engineering tolerances for a *missile warhead* are far *more* strict. Because not only do you have to do everything you've already done backwards and in heels, as they say, you have to do it in such a way that the thing can be *shot into space on top of a rocket* and still work when it comes back down!\n\nSo the bottom line is \u2026\u00a0it's hard. It's just an inherently difficult thing to do. It's not *impossible,* clearly, as many people have done it over the years. But it's very difficult nevertheless.",
