However, in some cases, Netflix removes content due to its potential impact on its target audience, particularly children. For instance, Netflix removed the suicide scene from the first season of 13 Reasons Why after acknowledging the harmful effects it may have on young viewers [4, 5]. Additionally, the company may remove content to edit or alter it, as seen in the case of the same show [5]. The reasons for content removal are not limited to these cases, as different streaming services may cater to different audiences and age groups, with their own unique content offerings [2, 3].

            "output": " [1] Steak tartare is okay to serve when undercooked beef isn't because the meat is specially prepared to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination [2]. This is supported by the fact that when handling quality beef and keeping it refrigerated until serving, there is little cause for alarm [1]. [3] However, there have been instances where Salmonella was found in raw meats, including steak tartare, highlighting the importance of proper handling and storage. [3] The risk of bacterial contamination can be further reduced by serving the steak tartare with other foods, such as toasted bread, capers, or pickles, which can cut through the richness of the dish [4, 5]. Overall, when served properly, steak tartare is a safe and enjoyable dish. [1]. [4, 5] suggest serving the tartare with a variety of accompaniments to enhance the eating experience. [2] underscores the importance of using quality beef and proper handling to ensure the dish remains safe to eat. [3] highlights the potential risks associated with consuming raw beef, emphasizing the need for caution. Overall, the answer suggests that steak tartare is okay to serve when undercooked beef isn't because it is prepared with care and attention to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination, and when served with other foods, the risk is even further reduced.

            "output": " Gypsies are a group of people who have been viewed in a negative light in the media, often stigmatized and stereotyped [1]. This negative perception is rooted in their own self-criticism and self-doubt, as they may harbor feelings of being unworthy, badly flawed, or just plain bad [2]. In some cases, this negative self-perception may even lead individuals to fabricate illnesses or injuries for personal gain, such as Dee Dee and Gypsy in the case documented in [4] and [5]. The negative light in which Gypsies are often seen may be attributed to their own internal conflict and struggles with their identity, rather than external factors. It is essential to recognize and challenge these negative stereotypes to promote greater understanding and acceptance of the Gypsy community."

Life is just so dull for him that he doesn't see meaning anymore. He turns to drugs.\n\nHis doctor tries to give him tough love, tells him to attend a support group. Hopefully this will make him realize life isn't so bad for him.\n\nUNLESS! He becomes addicted to the sensation of being cared for at an anonymous level in these groups. \n\nHe goes to so many, creates so many fake stories and alibis, that he forgets his own name. He suffers an identity crisis. \n\nIn fact, his identity crisis breaks into multiple personality syndrome at some level. He becomes vaguely aware of one of his alters, who gives a name Tyler Durden. Usually he has someone to talk to on the plane, but for once he gets an empty row, so out of habit he sees someone, surprise, it's his cool devil-may-care self. Extra points, he probably had explosives in the briefcase, which is also his because he's the only one there.\n\nOne day, his alter goes a little nuts, bombs his home elaborately, and they hang out at the bar. That's when our depressed, addictive personality schizo MC gets a *crazy* idea, let's get into a fight together (by myself).\n\nSome dudes see him beating himself up, and his alter kindof makes a cult out of it, doing devil-may-care things.\n\nBecause our MC is a loser, and he's only aware of his one alter, who is much cooler, he gets jealous.\n\nThe alter is apparently aware of his host personality, and simply doesn't care. He trolls him for a while.\n\nUltimately, MC decides to take charge like his idol, and shoots his own face. Either by neuroscience or self therapy, he is cured of his multiple psychoses. \n\nTeal deer:\n\nDepressed, possible PTSD from his work analyzing insurance claims\n\nAvoidant personality\n\nAddictive personality\n\nMultiple personalities\n\nAware of one alternate self\n\nJealous type\n\nHits rock bottom\n\nHappily ever after.",

If the end purpose of guns is to just say, kill or incapacitate someone or something, why are certain types of firearms preferred in a situation over another?",
            "answer": "This could have a very, very long answer. Very basic: a rifle is for long-distance shots, and has more power and better accuracy than a handgun. A handgun is more portable, and easier to maneuver in tight quarters. A shotgun has a wide spread, for more damage in close quarters and less need to aim. An SMG was originally designed to quickly clear enemy trenches: it's essentially a machine gun that shoots handgun rounds. A machine gun is designed to do the same things as a rifle, just with more rounds, and thus a better chance of a kill. It's also good for suppressive fire.",

According to document [1], infrared signals can only pass through transparent or empty space, which means that remotes relying solely on infrared signals may only work when pointed directly at the TV. On the other hand, some remotes, like those using an infrared emitter on the front of the remote, can work when pointed in any direction [5]. For remotes with advanced features, such as those on Samsung TVs [3], [4], the remote control must be paired with the TV before it can function properly, which can only be achieved by pointing the remote control directly at the TV and pressing two buttons simultaneously. The \"point anywhere\" feature on some remotes may be a result of the TV's ability to detect the infrared signal emitted by the remote control from any angle, but the exact technology behind this feature is not specified in the provided documents. [2] provides a general distinction between TV remotes with and without the \"point anywhere\" feature, but it does not offer further details on the underlying technology.

            "output": " Preemptive strikes were crucial in the Middle East as countries like Israel, Iran, and Iraq had the potential to attack other countries first, leading to a war. However, North Korea has been threatening the US with a preemptive nuclear strike, promising to wipe out the US mainland and reduce it to ashes, if the US plans to target their country [1][5]. Pyongyang is ready to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the US if it sees that Washington is planning to target their country, a top North Korean official said, adding that the country is capable of conducting more nuclear tests [1][2]. This threat is not being taken lightly by the US, and the US military buildup near North Korea is being taken as a threat of invasion, making it unlikely that the US will launch a preemptive strike against North Korea [4]. The reason why the US is not enacting a preemptive strike is due to the escalation of tensions with Russia and China, which could lead to a larger conflict if the US takes action against North Korea [4]. In contrast, countries in the Middle East did not have the same level of global influence and complex international relationships as North Korea does, making a preemptive strike a more viable option [3]. According to a Pyongyang official, a preemptive strike is not something the US has a monopoly on, and that if they see the US would do it to them, they would do it first [3]. Therefore, the US may not be acting on"

            "question": "How is dust formed ",
            "question_ctx": "",
            "answer": "It's interesting when you look at dust in the full scale that it really is: dust is everywhere. Literally. The bits that ultimately make up dust are so tiny, it's like salt in the ocean; you're breathing it in right now as you read this. Don't worry though, it's harmless (in normal conditions) and a main factor is dead skin anyway, so it's as bad as chewing your nails, if that at all.\n\nI say that last part for a point. The \"origin\" of dust is everywhere, but the consistently noticeable contributor is dead skin. And you're doing it right now. Right this second, hundreds of tiny tiny bits are floating off your arms and legs like daffodils. Don't believe me? Go in a room with some harsh light contrast (for us photographers, that's fancy talk for a room with a source of really strong light, like a window, but otherwise pretty unlit) and rub your arms a few times, watch the tiny little flakes float off. Your hair is even worse, regardless of dandruff, because it can get caught in the hairs, so if you ruffle your hair, boom, a mini-snowstorm.\n\nSo now we know where it comes from (everything) and where it's found (everywhere) but why don't we see it all over the place? And why do we see it layered on top of undisturbed things like an abandoned home or that space on the top of your TV? Well, both questions are answered by one word: wind. The dust is so tiny, it takes a lot of dust (and in dust terms, we're talking thousands of particles) to weigh it down to one place. The slightest breeze prevents this, so busy, open places with wind or high traffic are naturally void of any build up. Alternatively, when dust is given the time, those particles rub against each other, develop static cling, and clump. This is also why you see cobwebs that are so thick they sometimes drop to the floor.\n\n**TL;DR Dust is dust because we are slowly dying and do nothing to stop it.**",

Astronomers have also proposed the idea of \"dust trapping\" as a potential solution to the problem of how planets form, where dust particles are trapped in the formation process rather than drifting into the central star and being destroyed [3]. Another way dust forms is through the process of dust devils, which are rotating columns of air that lift dirt and debris into the air, often in hot and dry environments [4]. Furthermore, scientists have discovered that the trace elements originated in supernovae eventually \"clump\" into dust, explaining how dust is formed in the universe [5].

            "output": " Voyager is not travelling at ridiculous speeds. According to [1], nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and Voyager is not capable of such speeds. Voyager is actually a space probe that was launched in 1977 and has been traveling at an average speed of about 0.006% of the speed of light, or about 38,000 miles per hour [2].  As for how much faster Voyager could go, it's not possible according to our current understanding of physics. However, there are studies and experiments being conducted to see if it's possible to make objects travel faster than a bullet, such as those being conducted at the University of Queensland's Centre for Quantum Dynamics [5]. They are exploring the idea of using exotic matter to create a \"warp bubble\" that would allow an object to move at speeds greater than light, but this is still purely theoretical and has not been proven. It's important to note that even if it were possible to create a warp bubble, it would not be able to travel back in time, as the laws of physics do not allow for time travel [1].  It's also important to note that Voyager is not a spacecraft that can be accelerated to high speeds, it's a space probe that uses gravity and solar sails to change its trajectory and speed [3]. As for the Orville, it's a fictional spacecraft that can travel faster than light, but it's not based on real physics and is more of a thought experiment"

            "output": " The sensation of having to pee while in water is due to the redistribution of blood caused by the hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy effect when entering the water, which pushes blood from the legs and feet to the chest [2]. This increases blood volume in the urinary tract, leading to increased pressure and urgency to urinate [1]. Additionally, the sensation of having to pee can also be psychological, as the phrase \"making the water tinkle\" in Document [3] suggests, implying that the act of urination can become a sought-after activity when prompted [3]. However, it is worth noting that the specific reason for needing to pee in water is unique to each individual, and may not be applicable to everyone [5]. Ultimately, the sensation of having to pee while in water is a complex phenomenon influenced by both physical and psychological factors. [1] [2] [3] [5]. (156 words). 1.

            "answer": "The Austrian School of economic thought basically says that the decisions of individuals matter more than that of a group of people together. Obviously a group of people has more pull than any one person, but this school more scrutinizes what each individual person in the group does, whereas most other schools of economics don't care about that they only want to know what the end result of the activities of the group in question.\n\nFor example: 5 friends go to a bar, 4 of them buy one drink, and one of them gets bombed and gets 11 drinks. On average they got 3 each, so most economists would care about that, however the austrian school really wants to know why that one guy got bombed and the others didn't. \n\n_URL_0_\n\nThe Chicago School focuses on rejecting keynesianism in favor of neo-classicalism. \n\nWhat are these two theories? Keynesianism is the theory that the government should intervene in the market in order to achieve the best possible result. For example: Keynesians are usually in favor of \"smoothing out the business cycle\". When times are good, they raise taxes and cut government spending, to achieve a government surplus and not allow the economy to get too out of hand. When the economy is bad, they lower taxes and boost spending, running deficits in order to boost economic activity and get things going again. Their main goal is to have a steady amount of small growth, rarely having big booms or recessions/depressions.\n\nNeoclassicalism on the other hand is the opposite. It aims to have as little government intervention in the economy as possible and believes this contributes to the best economic picture. In this type of system the government attempts to keep itself neutral at all times, rarely running surpluses or deficits. It allows bubbles to form and burst as they will, leading to large fluctuations in the state of the economy. Sometimes things are awesome and sometimes they suck. However they believe that over time the awesomeness more than cancels out the suck (to put it basically). \n\n_URL_1_\n\nI can't really explain why academia doesn't accept the austrian school, but at first glance it seems a little suspect. I am no economist however I did take a few economics classes back in the day, and I definitely think the Chicago school makes more sense, or even keynesianism (which I am not a big fan of).",

The Austrian School of Economics is a type of economic thought that is based on the idea of methodological individualism [3].

            "answer": "tl;dr: your brain is basically an xbox and life is a video game you're trying really hard not to lose your last life in. when you have a week long dream in a single night, it's basically like playing non-stop through a week of in-game time over the course of like 40 out-of-game minutes.\n\n--\n\nboring rambling:\n\nSo your brain isn't actually very good at rendering the real world. Instead what you get is a really really really good near-real-time updated 3d simulation of a convenient-to-navigate model of the universe.\n\nThink of it this way. Most of the matter around you is made up of completely empty space. A rock you press against isn't actually solid, but your brain represents it as such to you, because at the scale which you exist, that representation is a lot more useful than what's actually there.\n\nWhich, for reference, is basically little bits of nothing deflecting other little bits of nothing with big powerful fields that extend far beyond the meager size of the actual atomic components.\n\nMore so, time itself doesn't actually \"flow\" so much as it exists as a convenient metric by which we can measure change in our own existence. In reality, time is inherently locked together with space into what is called (and you've likely heard of) spacetime. One of the consequences of this is that you shouldn't think of time as some kind of a line that a 3d cube (representing the universe) is moving along. Rather, the reason photons never \"age\" is because they're moving at the speed of light. Anything moving that fast experiences \"0 time\", as it were.\n\nAll this to say: your brain is basically a super-duper powered xbox capable of an incomprehensible number of computations. [1 second of simulated brain activity took almost 85,000 processors](_URL_0_). It takes in a ridiculous number of inputs from the outside world and uses these to create a coherent model of your surroundings, which is really very beneficial to your continued survival. But, it also means you can dismiss the notion that your brain is just a thing inside your head and that you're living in the same \"world\" that you perceive.\n\nA dream which \"takes you through a week\" isn't actually moving you through a week. It's unclear exactly what's happening, and I'm not a cognitive scientist or expert on the actual neruomechanical goings-on so I'll abstain from saying anything about that.",

[4] For instance, in the first few sleep cycles of the night, REM is extremely short, but as the night goes on, you spend longer periods in REM sleep, which can result in more vivid and longer-lasting dreams. [3] Furthermore, polyphasic sleep can deliver hard-hitting dreams almost every time, coupled with the deepest sleep, which can also contribute to the feeling of a longer dream duration. Overall, the combination of vivid dreams, sleep paralysis, and longer periods of REM sleep can create the illusion that the dream went on for much longer than it actually did.

The rocket is accelerated to escape velocity, and it leaves the Earth at great speed, but since the Earth's gravitational field extends infinitely, the rocket would always be slowly accelerating towards the Earth. So the rocket would get slower and slower, and as its distance from Earth reached infinity, its speed would reach zero.\n\nJust like the electron getting knocked out of a material, it initially has a nonzero speed, but slows down to zero speed at an infinite distance away.\n\nEdit: There's also a few other differences between gravitational fields and the fields that influence electrons; force due to gravity is inversely proportional to distance^2, but the forces between an electron and an atom are not as simple. The force when an electron is near an atom is incredibly strong, but the force even a few more nano-meters away almost fully disappears, so an electron that is ejected with JUST the right amount of energy will have practically no (but still nonzero) kinetic energy as it moves away from the material it was ejected from.",

The surplus energy (hf - W) is taken away by the electron as its kinetic energy. If the energy of the photon is equal to or greater than the work function, the electron can leave the metal surface and gain kinetic energy [2, 3, 5]. The energy of the photon can be used to liberate the electron from the metal surface [4]. The minimum energy required for the electron to be ejected from the metal surface is the work function of the metal [3, 5]. If the energy of the photon is less than the work function, no photoelectric emission can occur [1]. Therefore, only electrons with sufficient energy can leave the metal plate."

Additionally, down feathers are naturally hypoallergenic and breathable, making them a popular choice for individuals with allergies and sensitive skin [2].

If the process is a runaway reaction (each step makes the next step more effective) you get an explosion. If the amount of new products relative to old is poor, you get something like NK nukes, where some of it goes boom, but most of it just heats up to gas or gets blown apart by the first.

[3] This is because, when an atom splits, it causes other atoms to split, resulting in a chain reaction that leads to an atomic explosion. [3] The exponential increase in atoms splitting, and their combined energy is the bomb, as described in Document [4] and [5]. [4], [5] This process is unique to the atom, as other particles do not have the same properties, and it is this unique property that allows for the enormous amount of energy released in a nuclear explosion. [1] The chain reaction can lead to an observable chaos, such as a mushroom cloud, as seen in a nuclear explosion. [3] Hence, splitting an atom causes an explosion by initiating a chain reaction that releases a massive amount of energy. [3] References: [1], [3], [4], [5]."

            "output": " We are afraid to look each other in the eye due to various reasons. According to St. Francis of Assisi [1, 2], we might be afraid of what we truly are in God's eyes, and this fear can prevent us from spending time with Christ. This fear can also lead to avoiding time with friends, as we might not want to look past each other's faults. On the other hand, according to Irish political philosopher Philip Pettit [3], we can look each other in the eye without fear or deference, which is a fundamental condition of being in a Republic. This basic equality allows us to feel equal and not be afraid of or defer to each other, which is essential to human dignity. Furthermore, as mentioned in [4], we were designed to stare at one another, to admire each other's beauty, soul, mind, and everything. However, as seen in [5], sometimes we might be afraid to look at each other because of what we might find out about the other person. For instance, Jack in the story was afraid that the narrator would find out what he was really like, which led him to look away. In conclusion, our fear of looking each other in the eye can be due to various reasons, including fear of what we truly are, fear of what we might find out about each other, and fear of equality and human dignity.

            "output": " The difference in quality of gas(petroleum) from different companies can be attributed to various factors. For instance, British Petroleum is known for its good quality of services, oil and gas products [1]. This could be due to their emphasis on quality control, as seen in the focus of the Department of Chemical Studies and Quality Control Laboratories, which assesses the quality control of crude oil and decomposition of associated gases produced from different fields [2]. On the other hand, different companies operating in Pakistan's gas sector, such as Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Pakistan Petroleum Limited, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, and Fauji have been granted diverse licenses by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) to transmit and sell gas to various entities across the country [3]. This diversity in licenses could potentially lead to variations in the quality of gas products offered by these companies. Furthermore, the quality of gas can also depend on the specific origin and destination of the gas, as seen in the example of France, where gas production, transit, storage, distribution, and sales to different customers and industries are managed by various companies and entities [5]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference in quality of gas from different companies is influenced by a combination of factors, including quality control measures, licenses granted by regulatory authorities, and the specific operational context.

            "answer": "Many of the good artists (not taggers) use stencils and cutouts, basically they just hold the stencil up and spray the critical areas. This is done while using proper safety gear if they are in a dangerous area.\n\nOthers of the good artists (not usually taggers) are fairly skilled artists in their own right. I've known some people who work as professional graffiti artists who are paid for their murals, and they study art quite seriously. When they put up their art they often use a cherrypicker or similar boom lift.\n\nTaggers usually do little more than their well-practice name scribble as part of vandalism. The street credential is in putting the damaging tag in a visible location that remains up for an extended length of time. A quick search of Google news shows reports about taggers who fell to their death or fell to extreme injury while trying to tag in dangerous places without appropriate safety gear. Many of them are taking risks, perhaps freecliming or occasionally using a simple climbing harness, to put their vandalism on the wall.\n\nWe had some high rise buildings tagged quite high a few years back. Police found surveillance videos showing them scaling the building without climbing gear, tagging it, and scaling back down. It was quite scary to watch the video, i'm guessing that further increases their street credentials as being fearless.",

As Document [1] explains, some graffiti artists, known as \"taggers,\" spend a lot of time creating elaborate and decorative forms of graffiti, which requires a great deal of practice and control over their spray cans. [1] Chester Wallnuts, a graffiti writer, shares his personal experience learning how to use a spray can and creating elaborate pieces of art, despite the difficulty. [2] This level of skill and creativity allows them to produce intricate and detailed designs that can be applied to hard-to-reach areas, such as high walls, bridges, or rooftops. [2, 4] Additionally, the need to defend their work and reputation within the graffiti community can drive artists to push their skills and creativity even further, leading to even more elaborate and complex designs. [3] This competitive environment, combined with the artistic desire to create something unique and impressive, drives graffiti artists to challenge themselves and take on increasingly difficult projects, including those on extremely hard-to-reach places. [4, 5] Ultimately, the combination of skill, creativity, and dedication enables graffiti artists to create intricate and elaborate designs on hard-to-reach areas.

For many women, super duper absorbent tampons are not going to be comfortable to wear if your flow isn't heavy enough for them. Any company that would switch to only producing super heavy flow tampons would see their sales figures crash enormously.\n\nAdditionally, it is not healthy to just leave a tampon in there longer. It is not as common anymore, but wearing tampons, especially super absorbent ones is a risk factor for [Toxic Shock Syndrome] (_URL_0_). The best way to cut the risk is to frequently change your tampon.\n\nedit: to add, removing a tampon that is mostly dry (which is what many women would constantly have to do if they'd wear super absorbent tampons when their flow is not heavy enough), is at best really uncomfortable, at worst actually a bit painful.",

The documents focus on storing guns, gun safety, and gameplay mechanics.** However, we can explain the action of recoil in guns according to [5]. When a gun is fired, the recoil action is not directed at the center of gravity of the gun but above it. This means that the force of the recoil is not enough to lift the gun up against gravity. The documents do not address why a gun would want to go up when fired, as it is not related to the topic of gun safety, storage, or gameplay mechanics discussed in the documents.

This is possible due to the similarities in formulation, manufacturing processes, and packaging [1]. Equate can also use the same suppliers and factories as major brands, which can result in products that are nearly indistinguishable from their branded counterparts [5]. Furthermore, store brands often use similar marketing strategies and branding tactics as major brands, which can make it difficult for consumers to distinguish between the two [3]. According to HowStuffWorks, many store brands are able to sell nearly identical products for a much lower price than brand names [1]. By producing products that are almost identical to major brands, Equate can offer high-quality products at a lower price point, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers [2].

Additionally, regular workouts allow for a more gradual increase in intensity and effort, reducing the likelihood of overexertion and resulting muscle soreness [4]. When you work out regularly, you may not feel the effects of soreness as intensely, as your body becomes more efficient at recovering from exercise [2]. Furthermore, gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts can help reduce muscle soreness, as your body adapts to the new demands placed on it [5]. In contrast, infrequent and intense workouts can lead to more severe muscle soreness due to the increased stress on the muscles [3]. Overall, consistent and moderate exercise is more likely to result in reduced muscle soreness compared to sporadic and intense exercise. [1, 4]"

However, some people believe that MSG is bad for health because it has been linked to various health issues, such as obesity [5] and excessive glutamate in the brain [3]. Additionally, some individuals claim that MSG causes side effects like headaches, sweating, and flushing [4], which could be caused by the nocebo effect [4]. Despite these concerns, some studies suggest that MSG might not be bad for health and could even be used to help people eat a healthy diet [2].
