The high cost of healthcare is a significant issue in the US [1][3], and solving it should be the main focus, rather than just who pays [3]. The reason for this may be because the healthcare system in the US is unique in the way that doctors set their own salaries, which drives up costs [2]. As a result, the debate tends to focus on payment rather than cost [1][3]. It is worth noting that other countries have more efficient healthcare systems and that healthcare costs are generally lower in those countries [3].

If scientists tried to do all of this work by hand, or just using the computers in their lab, it would take forever. By taking advantage of 'distributed computing' (i.e.: thousands of computers around the world), we can get it done much faster.\n\nNote: when your computer 'finishes' a work unit, this doesn't mean it has 'solved' the protein. Your little packet might only be a *thousandth* of the total workload. So - to the end user - it can seem like a very slow, very boring process. And it kind of is.\n\nBut - when all this data is pulled together - it creates an amazing database. Eventually, we might have enough data to start creating effective and long-lasting treatments for some conditions. In time, we may even be able to *cure* diseases completely (we already have some really exciting leads, but putting that theory into practice is another matter).
