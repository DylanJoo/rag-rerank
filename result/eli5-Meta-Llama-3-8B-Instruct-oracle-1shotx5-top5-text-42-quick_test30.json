The movie is all about fighting the system and the struggle within oneself, but it's hard to fully grasp the themes and messages without some understanding of the human psyche and the societal commentary it's making. It's like trying to decipher a song's lyrics, like \"On The Line\" by the Jonas Brothers [1], where you know the emotions and emotions, but the context is hard to understand without context [2]. Similarly, the dialogue in Fight Club can be cryptic and confusing, like the conversation between John and the interviewer [2], where the speaker is trying to convey a message, but it's not always clear what that message is. Even the characters in the movie are unsure of what they want, like Tina Turner's song \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", where the speaker is trying to resist the urge to fight, but is unsure of their motivations [3]. It's a complex and thought-provoking movie that requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate its depth and meaning [4]."

An SMG was originally designed to quickly clear enemy trenches: it's essentially a machine gun that shoots handgun rounds.

(Of course that doesn't mean that the other end that plugs into the wall will have to also have these features).\n\nThe plugs are compatible with the inlets of the unearthed version of the standard (C17/C18) and the inlets are compatible with the plugs of the higher temperature versions of the standard (C15(a)/C16(a)).\n\nThey are rated for up to 10 ampere and incompatible with the plugs and inlets of the standards for more or less Ampere.\n\nAll that is designed to keep people from accidentally frying their equipment, themselves or burning their house down to easily.",

            "output": " The difference between the importance of \"preemptive strikes\" in the Middle East and the lack of such strikes against North Korea lies in the fact that North Korea has been actively threatening the US with its nuclear capabilities, whereas the US has been more cautious in its approach to prevent a devastating war in the Middle East [1].  Meanwhile, North Korea has been warning the US with preemptive nuclear strikes, promising to take action before the US does [2][3]. The reason behind North Korea's threats is that the country perceives US military drills and nuclear presence as a threat to its security and sovereignty, prompting its leaders to adopt a preemptive posture [4].  In contrast, the US had previously been more reluctant to engage in preemptive strikes in the Middle East due to the risks of devastating wars and international condemnation [5]."

            "question_ctx": "",
            "answer": "It's interesting when you look at dust in the full scale that it really is: dust is everywhere. Literally. The bits that ultimately make up dust are so tiny, it's like salt in the ocean; you're breathing it in right now as you read this. Don't worry though, it's harmless (in normal conditions) and a main factor is dead skin anyway, so it's as bad as chewing your nails, if that at all.\n\nI say that last part for a point. The \"origin\" of dust is everywhere, but the consistently noticeable contributor is dead skin. And you're doing it right now. Right this second, hundreds of tiny tiny bits are floating off your arms and legs like daffodils. Don't believe me? Go in a room with some harsh light contrast (for us photographers, that's fancy talk for a room with a source of really strong light, like a window, but otherwise pretty unlit) and rub your arms a few times, watch the tiny little flakes float off. Your hair is even worse, regardless of dandruff, because it can get caught in the hairs, so if you ruffle your hair, boom, a mini-snowstorm.\n\nSo now we know where it comes from (everything) and where it's found (everywhere) but why don't we see it all over the place? And why do we see it layered on top of undisturbed things like an abandoned home or that space on the top of your TV? Well, both questions are answered by one word: wind. The dust is so tiny, it takes a lot of dust (and in dust terms, we're talking thousands of particles) to weigh it down to one place. The slightest breeze prevents this, so busy, open places with wind or high traffic are naturally void of any build up. Alternatively, when dust is given the time, those particles rub against each other, develop static cling, and clump. This is also why you see cobwebs that are so thick they sometimes drop to the floor.\n\n**TL;DR Dust is dust because we are slowly dying and do nothing to stop it.**",

            "output": " The feeling of having to pee when being in water is primarily caused by the shift in blood pressure and buoyancy [1]. This hydrostatic pressure pushes blood from the legs and feet towards the chest, creating an instant redistribution of blood. This increased blood pressure in the chest area stimulates the kidneys to increase urine production, resulting in the urge to pee. This effect is more noticeable when diving, as the pressure change is more dramatic [1]. So, being in water can make you pee because the body is adapting to the changed environment [5]."

            "output": " When you buy an old game on Steam or GOG and the developers and publishers are out of business, your money generally goes to the current owners of the game, whether it's the game's original publisher or a third-party company that acquired the rights [1]. However, if the game is on GOG, a DRM-free digital distribution platform, you still own the game and can play it even if the original developers and publishers are out of business [3]. In contrast, Steam, a digital distribution platform that uses digital rights management (DRM), may make it difficult for you to access the game if the original developers and publishers are no longer around [1]. GOG's business model is more appealing to some users as it offers a DRM-free experience [2][3], which allows users to own the game and play it without needing an internet connection."

            "question": "What is Austrian School of Economic thought ?",
            "question_ctx": "1. What is praxeology ?\n\n2. How is it different from Chicago School?\n\n3. Why isn't it taken seriously by academia ?\n\n4. How legitimate is it ?",
            "answer": "The Austrian School of economic thought basically says that the decisions of individuals matter more than that of a group of people together. Obviously a group of people has more pull than any one person, but this school more scrutinizes what each individual person in the group does, whereas most other schools of economics don't care about that they only want to know what the end result of the activities of the group in question.\n\nFor example: 5 friends go to a bar, 4 of them buy one drink, and one of them gets bombed and gets 11 drinks. On average they got 3 each, so most economists would care about that, however the austrian school really wants to know why that one guy got bombed and the others didn't. \n\n_URL_0_\n\nThe Chicago School focuses on rejecting keynesianism in favor of neo-classicalism. \n\nWhat are these two theories? Keynesianism is the theory that the government should intervene in the market in order to achieve the best possible result. For example: Keynesians are usually in favor of \"smoothing out the business cycle\". When times are good, they raise taxes and cut government spending, to achieve a government surplus and not allow the economy to get too out of hand. When the economy is bad, they lower taxes and boost spending, running deficits in order to boost economic activity and get things going again. Their main goal is to have a steady amount of small growth, rarely having big booms or recessions/depressions.\n\nNeoclassicalism on the other hand is the opposite. It aims to have as little government intervention in the economy as possible and believes this contributes to the best economic picture. In this type of system the government attempts to keep itself neutral at all times, rarely running surpluses or deficits. It allows bubbles to form and burst as they will, leading to large fluctuations in the state of the economy. Sometimes things are awesome and sometimes they suck. However they believe that over time the awesomeness more than cancels out the suck (to put it basically). \n\n_URL_1_\n\nI can't really explain why academia doesn't accept the austrian school, but at first glance it seems a little suspect. I am no economist however I did take a few economics classes back in the day, and I definitely think the Chicago school makes more sense, or even keynesianism (which I am not a big fan of).",

The Austrian School is known for its focus on the Austrian capital and interest theory, and its emphasis on the role of entrepreneurship and the importance of subjective value [3]. The school also places a strong emphasis on the concept of opportunity cost, and the idea that economic decisions are made based on human preferences and scarcity [4]. The Austrian School is a school of thought that emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, limited government intervention, and the idea that economics is a social science that can be understood through the study of human action [5].\nIn the context of the Austrian School of economic thought, the concept of economic freedom is very important. The Austrian School emphasizes the idea that economic freedom is the ability to make choices about how one wants to live, and that this freedom is the foundation of prosperity and economic growth [6]. In the Austrian view, economic freedom is based on the idea that individuals should be free to make their own decisions about how to allocate resources, without interference from the government [7]. This idea is in contrast to the Keynesian view, which emphasizes the importance of government"

            "question_ctx": "..took a 30min nap yesterday. Had a dream. Lived about a week in my dream. How is this possible?",
            "answer": "tl;dr: your brain is basically an xbox and life is a video game you're trying really hard not to lose your last life in. when you have a week long dream in a single night, it's basically like playing non-stop through a week of in-game time over the course of like 40 out-of-game minutes.\n\n--\n\nboring rambling:\n\nSo your brain isn't actually very good at rendering the real world. Instead what you get is a really really really good near-real-time updated 3d simulation of a convenient-to-navigate model of the universe.\n\nThink of it this way. Most of the matter around you is made up of completely empty space. A rock you press against isn't actually solid, but your brain represents it as such to you, because at the scale which you exist, that representation is a lot more useful than what's actually there.\n\nWhich, for reference, is basically little bits of nothing deflecting other little bits of nothing with big powerful fields that extend far beyond the meager size of the actual atomic components.\n\nMore so, time itself doesn't actually \"flow\" so much as it exists as a convenient metric by which we can measure change in our own existence. In reality, time is inherently locked together with space into what is called (and you've likely heard of) spacetime. One of the consequences of this is that you shouldn't think of time as some kind of a line that a 3d cube (representing the universe) is moving along. Rather, the reason photons never \"age\" is because they're moving at the speed of light. Anything moving that fast experiences \"0 time\", as it were.\n\nAll this to say: your brain is basically a super-duper powered xbox capable of an incomprehensible number of computations. [1 second of simulated brain activity took almost 85,000 processors](_URL_0_). It takes in a ridiculous number of inputs from the outside world and uses these to create a coherent model of your surroundings, which is really very beneficial to your continued survival. But, it also means you can dismiss the notion that your brain is just a thing inside your head and that you're living in the same \"world\" that you perceive.\n\nA dream which \"takes you through a week\" isn't actually moving you through a week. It's unclear exactly what's happening, and I'm not a cognitive scientist or expert on the actual neruomechanical goings-on so I'll abstain from saying anything about that.",

            "answer": "No, it would have enough kinetic energy to leave the material, but as it traveled farther and farther away, it would slow down, eventually reaching zero kinetic energy at an infinite distance.\n\nHere's an analogy; the Earth is a material, and a rocket is an electron. The rocket is accelerated to escape velocity, and it leaves the Earth at great speed, but since the Earth's gravitational field extends infinitely, the rocket would always be slowly accelerating towards the Earth. So the rocket would get slower and slower, and as its distance from Earth reached infinity, its speed would reach zero.\n\nJust like the electron getting knocked out of a material, it initially has a nonzero speed, but slows down to zero speed at an infinite distance away.\n\nEdit: There's also a few other differences between gravitational fields and the fields that influence electrons; force due to gravity is inversely proportional to distance^2, but the forces between an electron and an atom are not as simple. The force when an electron is near an atom is incredibly strong, but the force even a few more nano-meters away almost fully disappears, so an electron that is ejected with JUST the right amount of energy will have practically no (but still nonzero) kinetic energy as it moves away from the material it was ejected from.",

The minimum energy required to release an electron from the metal is called the work function (W) for the metal. This equates to the situation where a photon at the threshold frequency is absorbed by the least bound electron, and so W = hf0. For this case, the ejected photoelectron will escape with no kinetic energy. By considering only the least bound electron, Einstein was able to provide a mathematical treatment. If light whose frequency is greater than the threshold frequency (f > f0) shines on the metal in question, then a least bound\n\nAnswer: ",

            "output": " According to Einstein's photoelectric law, electrons can leave the metal surface when they absorb energy from a photon, with a frequency equal to or greater than the work function of the metal [1]. This energy is used to liberate the electron from the metal surface, and any surplus energy is taken away by the electron as its kinetic energy [1]. If the frequency of the photon is greater than the threshold frequency, the electron can leave the metal surface [2]. The work function is the minimum energy required to release an electron from the metal, and it is equal to the energy of the photon with the threshold frequency [3]. When a photon with energy greater than the work function is absorbed, the electron gains energy and can leave the metal surface [4]. In this process, the rest of the energy of the photon is used in imparting the maximum kinetic energy to the ejected electron [4]. The photoelectron will escape with kinetic energy if the frequency of the photon is greater than the threshold frequency [5]."

This difference is first formed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 A.D. [1][2].

The explosions were about the same. Just different designs. When a uranium bomb explodes, a small piece of uranium is fired into a bigger piece. When a plutonium bomb explodes, the plutonium metal is compressed and made denser. Why does the atomic explosion chain reaction stop? A chain reaction happens when one atom splits and causes other atoms to split. The result is an atomic explosion. But a chain reaction only works if the warhead stays in one piece.

            "output": " An atomic explosion is caused when an atom is split and causes other atoms to split, triggering a chain reaction [1][2]. This chain reaction releases a large amount of energy, which is what we see as an explosion [4]. The first atom to split causes multiple other atoms near it to split, and they in turn cause multiple atoms to split, leading to an exponential increase in atoms splitting, resulting in a powerful explosion [4]. This process can happen very quickly, often within a matter of milliseconds [4]. In a nuclear explosion, not only the initial atom splitting, but also the subsequent splitting of other atoms, contributes to the explosive energy [4]. The release of neutrons is a key factor in this process, as these neutrons can split other atoms, causing a chain reaction [2][5]. The powerful energy released is what makes a nuclear explosion so devastating [5]."

This fear can be rooted in various reasons such as fear of being rejected, fear of being hurt, or fear of being vulnerable [1][3][4]. The condition of being afraid to look each other in the eye can be seen as a result of our unequal relationship or of being intimidated by the other person [2][3]. As a result, we avoid making eye contact, which can lead to a lack of connection and understanding [2][3]. The power of eye contact can bring people closer together, but it also requires courage and vulnerability [3][5]."

An alternate display shows the last 40 minutes of lightning in different parts of the world on top of NASA cloud maps, which are updated from satellites every 30 minutes.

I've known some people who work as professional graffiti artists who are paid for their murals, and they study art quite seriously. When they put up their art they often use a cherrypicker or similar boom lift.\n\nTaggers usually do little more than their well-practice name scribble as part of vandalism. The street credential is in putting the damaging tag in a visible location that remains up for an extended length of time. A quick search of Google news shows reports about taggers who fell to their death or fell to extreme injury while trying to tag in dangerous places without appropriate safety gear. Many of them are taking risks, perhaps freecliming or occasionally using a simple climbing harness, to put their vandalism on the wall.\n\nWe had some high rise buildings tagged quite high a few years back. Police found surveillance videos showing them scaling the building without climbing gear, tagging it, and scaling back down.

            "output": " Really elaborate graffiti can wind up on extremely hard to reach places through techniques such as sticker bombing [1], where the artist creates stickers that are then placed in different parts of the city [1]. Other artists use methods like graffiti \"pieces\" or \"bombs\" which are more elaborate and decorative forms of graffiti [2]. This art form is often illegal, and some artists take great care to avoid getting caught by the police while creating their art [2]. Additionally, some graffiti writers create their art in hard-to-reach places as a way to show off their skills and as a form of expression, as they can make a statement about their identity and community [3]. Elaborate graffiti can also be used as a form of socio-political commentary [4]. These elaborate pieces of graffiti can be incredibly detailed and have artistic value, but are often considered illegal [4]. Graffiti artists may also use different techniques, such as layering their work over existing graffiti, to create unique and elaborate pieces [5]."

When guns are stored upright, gravity pulls gun oil downward into the action, which forms a sticky film. Displaying guns in glass cabinets or wall racks is an invitation to thieves and curious children. Ideally, guns should be hidden from view and locked. Never leave a handgun lying in a place where a child might pick it up. When deciding how to store your firearms, consider your other family members, children, and visitors.

When a bullet is fired, the recoil force should start to spin the gun slightly so that the muzzle lifts up [3].

Gravity pulls gun oil downward into the action when guns are stored upright, which forms a sticky film [1]. The Gravity Gun, a weapon in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, uses a different principle and physics to interact with its environment [2]. In contrast, real guns use the recoil action of the gun to control their direction of firing [3]. When a person is shot, the force of gravity can also affect the direction of the bullet and the outcome of the injury [4]. It is also possible to use the force of gravity to slow down the bullet and affect the trajectory of the shot [5]."

It\u2019s soreness that you feel in your muscles that doesn\u2019t show up until a day or two after you work out (hence the \u2018delayed onset\u2019). It\u2019s a normal part of the process of repairing your muscles from the damage to the fibers you created while exercising. Expect to be more sore a few days after doing an exercise for the first time, or after not doing it for a while. As your muscles get used to that movement (and adapt to being put under stress), they will get less and less sore every time. So,\nDocument [2]: (Title: Why do you feel less sore when you continually work out? | Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine) work out to help inhibit the molecules in the muscles from breaking down too quickly. Within an hour, that lactic acid is gone. So there you have it. Working out can sometimes lead to sore muscles, and other times it does not, but that has little effect on the overall muscle growth. Just because people's muscles are sore does not mean they are filled with lactic acid, and workouts can become easier over time if you continually do the same activities without change. However, sometimes changing up the training regimen or trying new activities that test the muscles in different\nDocument [3]: (Title: Beginners Guide To Weight Lifting For Men & Women - MAKREN) that shows up between 24-48 hours after you work out. It\u2019s a normal part of the process of repairing your muscles. This usually is heavy after doing an exercise for the first time or after you took a break from exercising for a while. After doing a movement more, your muscles start to adapt to the movement and get used to it and they will get less and less sore every time. So one way to make the soreness go away a little faster is to keep those muscles moving to increase blood flow to the muscles. Don\u2019t get me\nDocument [4]: (Title: Why do you feel less sore when you continually work out? | Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine) to better prepare itself for next time. So if people train for the same length of time and do the same activities every day, the muscles will become more prepared for these exact activities and slowly will not be as sore. However, this does not mean people are not building muscle. It turns out that certain exercises might build muscle more quickly than others. For instance, when people run downhill, lower into a squat or push-up position, or lower weights, they are experiencing eccentric contraction, and this can lead to the muscles lengthening as they contract. While this can cause\nDocument [5]: (Title: Why do you feel less sore when you continually work out? | Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine) you cannot because you go immediately to muscle failure, you've done too much,\" National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) certified personal trainer Monica Vasquez told the Daily Bur Changing exercises can help continually make muscles sore. Understanding the metabolic process People also tend to believe that they are sore because of excessive lactic acid build up in their muscles. It turns out this is simply not true.

            "output": " Muscles tend to get less sore after a workout when you work out on a regular basis because your muscles adapt to the movement, decreasing the soreness over time [1]. As your muscles get used to the exercise, they will get less and less sore every time [1]. Additionally, your body adapts by repairing muscle fibers more quickly, making soreness decrease [2]. This decrease in soreness is a result of increased blood flow to the muscles, making it easier for your body to repair and adapt to the movement [3]. The muscles become more prepared for the exercises, resulting in decreased soreness over time [4]. Furthermore, exercising can lead to muscle damage and tearing, which causes soreness, but this injury is temporary and is not caused by lactic acid [5]."
