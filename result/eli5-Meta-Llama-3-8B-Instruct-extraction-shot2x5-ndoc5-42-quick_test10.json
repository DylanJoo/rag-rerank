The differences between the two groups are related to historical events, ideological heritage, and issues of leadership that emerged after the death of Prophet Muhammad in A.D. 632.\nDocument [2]: (Title: What\u2019s the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam? \u2013 Macrosnaps) Sunni and Shia Islam first formed around a dispute over leadership succession after the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD. Sunni is the larger branch, estimated to be 85-90% of total world Muslim population, while Shia are followers of Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin Ali. Sunnis rely heavily on the practice and teachings of Prophet Muhammad, while the Shia view their ayatollahs as reflections of God on earth.\nDocument [3]: (Title: Difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims | Sunni vs Shia Muslims) The document discusses the differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims, who are two primary sects of Islam.

This difference is first formed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 A.D. [1][2]. The ideological practice of the Sunni branch strictly follows Prophet Muhammad and his teachings, while the Shia branch follows Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law Ali [2].

However, the article does not provide any specific dates, numbers, or names related to the topic.\nDocument [2]: (Title: How Does Student Loan Debt Affect Buying a Home? | Experian) Student loan debt could make it more difficult to get a mortgage and 83% of non-homeowners say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a home, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nDocument [3]: (Title: Studentloanify - How your student loans affect your home mortgage prospects) Your student loan situation impacts your home mortgage outlook. The amount of the loan and how you handle repayment affects your ability to get a mortgage and your interest rate. On your mortgage application, you report your monthly student loan payment which is deducted from your monthly gross income.\nDocument [4]: (Title: How do student loans affect your credit score? | Student Loan Planner) The document discusses how student loans affect credit scores and their impact on obtaining loans such as a mortgage.\nDocument [5]: (Title: Does Student Loan Debt Affect Getting A Mortgage?) The document discusses the impact of student loan debt on getting a mortgage. The author shares reader questions and explores whether student loan debt affects mortgage eligibility.\n\nAnswer: When applying for a mortgage, student loans can affect the debt to income ratio, which is a key factor in determining the amount that an individual can afford to pay for the mortgage [1]. While student loan repayments do not appear in an individual's credit history and do not affect credit scores, lenders do consider the amount of an individual's student loan repayments when assessing their mortgage application [1][2][3]. Some 83% of non-homeowners say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a home, according to the National Association of Realtors [2]. It is important to note that student loans do not prevent an individual from getting a mortgage [1].\n\n\nQuestion: What is so special about filming with IMAX cameras?\n\nDocument [1]: (Title: Next-Generation Cinema Breaks Out - VFX Voice MagazineVFX Voice Magazine) IMAX cameras offer a unique filming experience and have been used in several major feature films, including Avengers: Infinity War, First Man, and Aquaman.

However, the article does not provide any specific dates, numbers, or names related to the topic.\nDocument [2]: (Title: How Does Student Loan Debt Affect Buying a Home? | Experian) Student loan debt could make it more difficult to get a mortgage and 83% of non-homeowners say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a home, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nDocument [3]: (Title: Studentloanify - How your student loans affect your home mortgage prospects) Your student loan situation impacts your home mortgage outlook. The amount of the loan and how you handle repayment affects your ability to get a mortgage and your interest rate. On your mortgage application, you report your monthly student loan payment which is deducted from your monthly gross income.\nDocument [4]: (Title: How do student loans affect your credit score? | Student Loan Planner) The document discusses how student loans affect credit scores and their impact on obtaining loans such as a mortgage.\nDocument [5]: (Title: Does Student Loan Debt Affect Getting A Mortgage?) The document discusses the impact of student loan debt on getting a mortgage. The author shares reader questions and explores whether student loan debt affects mortgage eligibility.\n\nAnswer: When applying for a mortgage, student loans can affect the debt to income ratio, which is a key factor in determining the amount that an individual can afford to pay for the mortgage [1]. While student loan repayments do not appear in an individual's credit history and do not affect credit scores, lenders do consider the amount of an individual's student loan repayments when assessing their mortgage application [1][2][3]. Some 83% of non-homeowners say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a home, according to the National Association of Realtors [2]. It is important to note that student loans do not prevent an individual from getting a mortgage [1].\n\n\nQuestion: Why is it that \"preemptive strikes\" were so important in the middle east but now that N.

            "question_ctx": "[removed]",
            "answer": "Because that's how our eyes work. We have 3 types of colour receptor that respond to different overlapping wavelengths of light. Our brains interpret signals from these as red, green and blue. \n\nEssentially every colour we can see is a combination of red, green and blue. Yellow is what we see when both the red and green receptors are activated. In other words, if our eyes see red and green light at the same time, our brains interpret that as yellow.\n\nThis works different to the \"primary colours\" you might have learnt as a small child. That's because then it was about paints. Paints work the opposite way, they remove colours of light rather than adding them. Yellow paint reflects red and green light, and absorbs blue. So when you mix it with blue, that absorbs red light, leaving just the green reflected. That's why mixing yellow and blue paint makes green.\n\nThe primary colours we teach small children are still not quite right, even when talking about paint. Really the primary colours of paint should be cyan, yellow and magenta. Each of them is a half way point between the primary colours of light, red, green and blue.",

            "answer": "OK. Starting at the basics... you will need at a minimum of a power generator and an energy storage device. If this is for an RV, the very basic you could do is simply run off the battery of the RV when it is off. If you want to extend that capability, adding more batteries would be trivial.\n\nI suspect that you want something more than that. If you want to burn less gas, then you will need something renewable. I would normally say add a generator, but you already have one under your hood. \n\nThe next option would probably be PV. This is fairly simple. All you need is a portable module. Maybe something like [this](_URL_0_).  To make a complete system, you would also need an inverter. Good practices tells us to slightly oversize the inverter to increase longevitiy. If you size your array for, say, 200W, it might be good to get a 250W inverter. \n\nNext, I would plug this inverter into a battery charger. This is required because all an inverter does is produce a clean sine wave... it doesnt know how to charge a battery. You may be able to purchase a packaged solar-battery charger deal. Kinda like [this](_URL_1_), but on a larger scale.\n\nHonestly, though, it really is that simple. A solar module, an inverter/charger combo and a battery. Hook up a receptacle to your inverter and *bam*, you should have enough power to run your laptop, PC and phone all night, no problem.",

It also briefly mentions the difference between BHP and WHP, but does not provide information on how to test torque.\nDocument [4]: (Title: Understanding Torque and Horsepower | Your Amazing Car) Torque refers to the amount of force that can be applied to rotate an object, while horsepower is the measure of work that can be done over time. Torque is responsible for acceleration, while horsepower is responsible for heavier work. The difference is due to the gearing system. No testing methods are mentioned.\nDocument [5]: (Title: Motorhead Memo: Shifting focus |) Torque is the measure of an engine's performance, while horsepower is a by-product of torque and rpm. When a vehicle's performance is tested, its torque is measured using a dynamometer. There is no machine in existence that measures horsepower.\n\nAnswer: ",
            "output": " Torque and horsepower are two measures of an engine's performance [1][2]. While both measure power, they measure different aspects of it. Torque is the measure of an engine's ability to generate force, while horsepower is the measure of its ability to generate work over a period of time [4]. The relationship between torque and horsepower is such that torque is maximized at the engine's optimal fuel mixture, and then begins to dwindle beyond that point [3]. Testing torque is typically done using a dynamometer, which measures the force produced by the engine [5]. The formula to calculate horsepower is torque multiplied by RPM, but torque is more responsible for acceleration, while horsepower is responsible for heavier work [2]."
