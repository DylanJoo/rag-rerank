While student loan repayments do not appear in an individual's credit history and do not affect credit scores, lenders do consider the amount of an individual's student loan repayments when assessing their mortgage application [1][2][3]. Some 83% of non-homeowners say student loan debt is preventing them from buying a home, according to the National Association of Realtors [2]. It is important to note that student loans do not prevent an individual from getting a mortgage [1].\n\n\nQuestion: Why did New York City try to ban food donations to the poor?\n\nDocument [1]: (Title: The Future Of America) Why did New York City try to ban food donations to the poor? - Mayor Bloomberg banned citizens from donating food directly to homeless shelters, claiming the city couldn't assess the salt, fat, and fiber content.\nDocument [2]: (Title: mayor bloomberg) New York City tried to ban food donations to the poor because Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration was singularly focused on what people eat and believed that the food might be salty or too high in calories.\nDocument [3]: (Title: New York City bans food donations - WND) New York City tried to ban food donations to government-run facilities serving the homeless because of an inability to control nutritional content, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The ban was criticized by a public policy advocate and no food can be given to government-run facilities at present.\n\nAnswer: New York City, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, banned citizens from donating food directly to homeless shelters because the city could not assess the salt, fat, and fiber content [1][2][3]. Bloomberg's administration was heavily criticized for losing their common sense by becoming too focused on what people eat [2].\n\n\nQuestion: Are diseases advertised on TV like Crohn's, Celiac, Restless Leg prevalent in other countries? If not, why?\n\nDocument [1]: (Title: Children With Irritable Bowel Syndrome Have Greater Prevalence of Celiac Disease) irrelevant\nDocument [2]: (Title: Crohn\u2019s Disease and Restless Leg Syndrome Link?)

There is no information on whether these diseases are prevalent in other countries.\nDocument [3]: (Title: Managing Restless Legs Syndrome With a Bar of Soap? Here's Why!) The document mentions Restless Leg Syndrome and its possible association with systemic inflammatory diseases or immune disorders such as Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Rheumatoid arthritis. It also mentions an association between Irritable Bowel Disease and small intestine bacterial overgrowth, which can lead to similar symptoms. There is no information provided regarding the prevalence of these diseases on TV advertisements or in other countries.\nDocument [4]: (Title: Crohn\u2019s Disease and Celiac Disease: A Dynamic Duo \u00ab Gluten-Free Simplicity) The document discusses the high prevalence of celiac disease in patients with Crohn's disease and suggests that a gluten-free diet may be beneficial. It does not provide information on the prevalence of these diseases in other countries.\nDocument [5]: (Title: Celiac disease vs. Crohn\u2019s disease, differences in symptoms, causes, and treatment) Both Crohn's and celiac disease have risk factors that include a family history of the condition. Crohn's disease is more prevalent in individuals under 30 years old, those of Eastern European descent, smokers, and those living in industrial countries or northern climates. Celiac disease has risk factors including a family history, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and autoimmune thyroid disease.\n\nAnswer: ",

            "answer": "Three operations tend to show up in hash functions: modular addition, bitwise logic, and multiplication by primes.\n\n[Modulo operations](_URL_0_) takes the remainder from division -- for example, 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, so `2 mod 7` is 1.\n\nModular addition takes modulo and uses it in addition. Instead of simply adding `A` and `B`, you add `A mod X` and `B mod X`. The result is equivalent to `(A + B) mod X`. This is handy because it creates a sort of \"wrapped\" addition, where the output value will never exceed `X`.\n\nBitwise logic allows you to use 2 or more bits of input to generate 1 bit of output. This is handy if you need to combine chunks of data in a hash. Some example operators include:\n\n* `AND` will output a 1 if all of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `OR` will output a 1 if one or more of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `XOR` will output a 1 if *exactly* one of its inputs is 1, or 0 otherwise\n\nPrime multiplication tends to show up a lot in cryptography, because factoring primes is computationally expensive, which means the operation is theoretically difficult to reverse.\n\nSo... let's say that one round of a hashing algorithm might take the hash output so far, `XOR` two chunks of data together to generate some value `H`, multiply `H` by a big prime number, then use modular addition to add that into its running total. After you do this enough times, you've consumed all of the chunks and generated a hash.\n\nThe precise algorithm is beyond ELI5 level, but you can read about it on Wikipedia, including a [pseudocode example](_URL_1_), if you're really curious.",

Sunni is the larger branch, estimated to be 85-90% of total world Muslim population, while Shia are followers of Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin Ali. Sunnis rely heavily on the practice and teachings of Prophet Muhammad, while the Shia view their ayatollahs as reflections of God on earth.\nDocument [3]: (Title: Difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims | Sunni vs Shia Muslims) The document discusses the differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims, who are two primary sects of Islam. It explains that both consider themselves Muslims and follow the will of God, but they have differences in certain aspects. However, it does not provide any specific details about the differences.\n\nAnswer: The main difference between Shia and Sunni Muslim is related to ideological heritage and issues of leadership [1]. This difference is first formed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 A.D. [1][2].
